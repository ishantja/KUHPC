Merging all faces of a cell
---------------------------
    - which are on the same patch
    - which make an angle < 60 degrees
      (cos:0.5)
    - as long as the resulting face doesn't become concave by more than 90 degrees
      (0=straight, 180=fully concave)

Merging 0 sets of faces.

No faces merged ...

Merging all points on surface that
- are used by only two boundary faces and
- make an angle with a cosine of more than 0.5.

No straight edges simplified and no points removed ...
